# Auto-Trade-Forex
Personal project while trying to self learn Python and how to use an API. Not organized. Trades on Oanda, either practice or real.

To work, Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2014, module v20, and module PyYAML must be installed. User must have an Oanda accound (either practice or real) and the "Token" variable in the python file must be changed to the users specific identification number.

The code is not organized and is all in one file (which is obviously not ideal), but I did learn a lot about how to debug and use python in a myriad of ways.
